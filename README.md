# Teensy-Gurdy
Code and design files for building your own hurdy gurdy-inspired, Teensy-powered synthesizer!


Update: I've been having a few problems off and on with the sensitivity of the touch plates. If yours isn't working correctly unless you touch a ground, this should help. Go into the .cpp file for the Adafruit MPR121 library and uncomment the line where it says 'uncomment here to use autoconfig.' 

Howdy friends, here's the code I'm currently running in the Teensy Gurdy video with some added comments and the STL's for the case. 
I didn't initially intend for others to be looking at this so some details are going to be hazy, 
I highly suggest you watch the Notes and Volts Teensy synthesizer series as I learned how to build this project from watching my old pal Dave. The schematic is also the same as his TS-1 project with the addition of connecting the MPR121 to the Teensy I2C pins

Here's a parts list for the project:

15x 10kA potentiometers

2x SPDT switches

1x encoder (I used this one: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rotary-Encoder-1000P-R-Incremental-Optical-Shaft-Working-Measurement-DC-5-24V-US/233759257400?hash=item366d233338:g:rYAAAOSwpE5fl7l~)

12x conductive surfaces (I used custom PCB's but you can use lots of things. Adafruit's page has some suggestions about what works best)

1x Adafruit MPR121 breakout board

1x Teensy 3.2

1x Teensy 3.x Audio Shield (Not strictly necessary unless you want stereo audio but you will need to redo some code to use the 3.2's built in DAC if you don't want this)

1x CD4067/ 74HC4067 multiplexer chip

1x 5V regulator (Use something suitable like a 7805 and power it per the datasheet. I'm just a guy on the internet, don't blow up your Teensy!)

1x Some kinda way to get electricity to the regulator, a battery might be cool? The hole on the faceplate is sized for this type: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Panel-Mount-2-1mm-DC-barrel-jack/263111763480?hash=item3d42aee618:g:uKIAAOSwOg9ZeyIZ

1x Some kinda way to get audio out. The hole on the faceplate is sized for a 1/4" audio jack

1x USB connector. I didn't build one of these into mine but I wish I did

1x A knob, I pulled one off of a dresser but make sure you have at least one so you can get your clothes out
